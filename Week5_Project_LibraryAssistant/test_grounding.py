Week 5 Project — Step 4 & 5: Grounding and Source Attribution Verification Test Suite
Tests:
- 3 in-catalog questions (e.g. Science Fiction, Distributed Systems, Software Craft)
- 1 out-of-catalog question to ensure the model admits "I don't have that information."
- Validates source attribution list.
